To work with the samples, please download the zipped version or clone the repository to an arbitrary location on your computer. The projects require at least Android Studio Arctic Fox. You
can download the latest version at https://developer.android.com/studio. Please follow the detailed installation instructions at https://developer.android.com/studio/install.

To open a project, launch Android Studio, click the *Open* button in the upper right
area of the *Welcome to Android Studio* window, and select the base directory of
the project in the folder selection dialog. Please make sure to **not** open the base directory
of the repository, because Android Studio would not recognize the projects. Instead, you
must pick the directory that contains the project you want to work with.

To run a sample app, you need a real device or an Android Emulator. Please make
sure that developer options and USB debugging are enabled on the real device, and
that the device is connected to your development machine via USB or WLAN. Please
follow the instructions at https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/
dev-options. You can also set up an Android Emulator. You can find detailed
instructions at https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator.
